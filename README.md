# seniorJavaTest
A software with implementation of the empty method and the lack of some pieces in the structure

This software is built as Spring boot microservice. 
There are two ReST APIs:
- one in GET to check if the service is up
- one in POST to solve a question. This question is choosen using a request attribute 'question'

There is a method with only //TODO as its implementation.
The test, for this case, is to implements a classic algoritmh: _Sum of Two Values_ into an array (passed as input).

The purpose is: a user clones this repo, implements the method and the set of missing class.

The missing class will solve the _Largest Sum Subarray_ algorithm.
